First, most presentations are saved in PowerPoint's XML format, which is inherently tedious and redundant. This complex format poses significant challenges for LLMs in interpreting the presentation layout and structure, let alone generating appealing slides in an end-to-end fashion. Second, the absence of comprehensive evaluation frameworks exacerbates this issue. Current metrics like perplexity and ROUGE fail to capture essential aspects of presentation quality such as narrative flow, visual design, and content impact. Moreover, ROUGE-based evaluation tends to reward excessive textual alignment with input documents, undermining the brevity and clarity crucial for effective presentations. These limitations highlight the urgent need for advancements in automated presentation generation, particularly in enhancing visual design and developing comprehensive evaluation frameworks.",

Inspired by this process, we design *PPTAgent* to decompose presentation generation into an iterative, edit-based workflow. In the first stage, given a document and a reference presentation, *PPTAgent* analyzes the reference presentations to extract semantic information, providing the textual description that identifies the purpose and data model of each slide. In the Presentation Generation stage, *PPTAgent* generates a detailed presentation outline and assigns specific document sections and reference slides to each slide. For instance, the framework selects the opening slide as the reference slide to present meta-information, such as the title and icon. *PPTAgent* offers a suite of editing action APIs that empower LLMs to dynamically modify the reference slide. By breaking down the process into discrete stages rather than end-to-end generation, this approach ensures consistency, adaptability, and seamless handling of complex formats.",

Our human evaluation studies validated the reliability and effectiveness of *PPTEval*. Results demonstrate that our method effectively generates high-quality presentations, achieving an average score of 3.67 across the three dimensions evaluated by *PPTEval*. These results, covering a diverse range of domains, highlight a high success rate of 97.8%, showcasing the versatility and robustness of our approach. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows: - We propose *PPTAgent*, a novel framework that redefines automatic presentation generation as an edit-based workflow guided by reference presentations. - We introduce *PPTEval*, the first comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses presentations across three key dimensions: Content, Design, and Coherence. - We publicly released the *PPTAgent* and *PPTEval* codebase, along with a curated presentation dataset, to facilitate future research in automatic presentation generation.",

We will provide formal definitions for both PPTAgent and the conventional method, illustrating their divergence. The conventional method for creating each slide S can be described in Equation 1, where n represents the number of elements on the slide, and C denotes the source content composed of sections and figures. Each element on the slide, ei, is defined by its type, content, and styling attributes, such as (Textbox, \"Hello\", {border, size, position, ... }). Compared to the conventional method, PPTAgent adopts an edit-based paradigm for creating new slides, addressing challenges in processing spatial relationships and designing styles. This approach generates a sequence of actions to modify existing slides. Within this paradigm, both the input document and the reference presentation serve as inputs. This process can be described as Equation 2, where m represents the number of generated actions. Each action ai represents a line of executable code, and Rj is the reference slide being edited.",

                    "content": "To facilitate presentation generation, we first cluster slides in the reference presentation and extract their content schemas. This structured semantic representation helps LLMs determine which slides to edit and what content to convey in each slide. Slides can be categorized into two main types based on their functionalities: slides that support the structure of the presentation (e.g., opening slides) and slides that convey specific content (e.g., bullet-point slides). We employ different clustering algorithms to effectively cluster slides in the presentation based on their textual or visual characteristics. For structural slides, we leverage LLMs to infer the functional role of each slide and group them accordingly, as these slides often exhibit distinctive textual features. For the remaining slides, which primarily focus on presenting specific content, we employ a hierarchical clustering approach leveraging image similarity. For each cluster, we infer the layout patterns of each cluster using MLLMs. Further details regarding this method can be found in Appendix C. After clustering slides to facilitate the selection of slide references, we further analyzed their content schemas to ensure purposeful alignment of the editing. Given the complexity and fragmentation of real-world slides, we utilized the context perception capabilities of LLMs to extract diverse content schemas. Specifically, we defined an extraction framework where each element is represented by its category, modality, and content. Based on this framework, the schema of each slide was extracted through LLMs' instruction-following and structured output capabilities. Detailed instructions are provided in Appendix E.",

                    "content": "In this stage, we begin by generating an outline that specifies the reference slide and relevant content for each slide in the new presentation. For each slide, LLMs iteratively edit the reference slide using interactive executable code actions to complete the generation process. Following human preferences, we instruct LLMs to create a structured outline composed of multiple entries. Each entry specifies the reference slide, relevant document section indices, as well as the title and description of the new slide. By utilizing the planning and summarizing capabilities of LLMs, we provide both the document and semantic information extracted from the reference presentation to generate a coherent and engaging outline for the new presentation, which subsequently orchestrates the generation process. Slide generation is guided by the outline, and the slide generation process iteratively edits a reference slide to produce the new slide. To enable precise manipulation of slide elements, we implement five specialized APIs that allow LLMs to edit, remove, and duplicate text elements, as well as edit and remove visual elements. To further enhance the comprehension of slide structure, inspired by Feng et al. and Tang et al., we convert slides from their raw XML format into an HTML representation, which is more interpretable for LLMs. For each slide, LLMs receive two types of input: text retrieved from the source document based on section indices, and captions of available images. The new slide content is then generated following the guidance of the content schema. Subsequently, LLMs leverage the generated content, HTML representation of the reference slide, and API documentation to produce executable editing actions. These actions are executed in a REPL environment, where the system detects errors during execution and provides real-time feedback for self-correction. The self-correction mechanism leverages intermediate results to iteratively refine the editing actions, enhancing the robustness of the generation process.",
