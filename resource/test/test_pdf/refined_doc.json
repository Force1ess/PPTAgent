However, creating high-quality presentations requires advanced presentation skills and significant effort. Given the inherent complexity of presentation creation, there is growing interest in automating the presentation generation process by leveraging the generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches often focus on textual content while neglecting layout design and presentation structures, making them impractical for real-world applications."

It first analyzes reference presentations to understand their structural patterns and content schemas, then drafts outlines and generates slides through code actions to ensure consistency and alignment."

The conventional method generates each slide S as a sum of elements (Equation 1), while *PPTAgent* adopts an edit-based paradigm, generating a sequence of actions to modify existing slides (Equation 2). This approach addresses challenges in processing spatial relationships and designing styles."

This structured semantic representation helps LLMs determine which slides to edit and what content to convey in each slide. Clustering is done based on textual or visual characteristics, and schema extraction ensures purposeful alignment of the editing process."

LLMs iteratively edit the reference slide using interactive executable code actions to complete the generation process. Specialized APIs allow LLMs to edit, remove, and duplicate text and visual elements, enhancing the robustness of the generation process."
