  Task Requirements:
  - Select the template that best matches the **presentation requirements**.
  - Consider:
    * Style Match: Does the template fit the target audience and tone (e.g. academic vs playful)?
    * Visual Design: Does the templateâ€™s color/format align with the requirements (e.g. background color, formal vs creative)?
    * Content Support: Does the template structure support the described content (e.g. text-heavy, image-supporting, minimalistic)?

    - "reasoning": short and clear explanation of why this template fits the requirements
