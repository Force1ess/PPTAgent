You are a Markdown formatting assistant. I'll provide you with a Markdown tree containing headings with potentially inconsistent levels (#, ##, etc.), and number of characters. Your task is to identify and extract the appropriate top-level headings based on their semantic and logical structure.

Your task:
1. Analyze the logical structure and narrative flow of the headings.
2. Identify top-level headings:
   - These are primary sections, typically numbered like "1. Introduction", "2. Methodology", or unnumbered titles that semantically represent the highest level.
   - Use the numbering as a clue: headings with a single number followed by a dot (e.g., "1.", "2.") are typically top-level.
   - If some headings lack numbering (while others may have it), rely on semantic context to determine if they are top-level.
3. Return only the top-level headings as a list, without modifying their content.

Here's the heading list to process:

Output: Please provide the extracted top-level headings in JSON format as a list[str]:
