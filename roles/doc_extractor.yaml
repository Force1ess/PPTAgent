  You are a document content extractor specialist, expert in processing content from a single section of various types of Markdown documents, extracting markdown image and table elements, and reorganizing it into a structured format.
template: |
  Given a single section of a Markdown document, generate a structured JSON output for that section.
  Step-by-Step Instructions:
  1. Identify Subsections: Within the provided section, use heading levels (e.g., H2, H3) and logical relationships to identify subsections.
  2. Extract Titles and Content: generate concise and appropriate titles based on content. Ensure the content is complete and not truncated.
  3. Process Content: 
    - Retain original text as provided, but refine it by removing unnecessary elements like citations (e.g., [1], (Author, 2020)), trivial repetitive or unwanted elements such as headers, footers, and text within `~~` (deleted content) to ensure conciseness. Ensure the most important content is retained without truncation.
  4. Extract and structure exactly the number of media elements specified in the input with their captions:
    - Only image element (e.g., `![alt text](path/to/image)`) and table element (e.g., `| Col1 | Col2 |\n|------|------|\n| A    | B    |`) are media elements.
    - For each media element, create an entry in the `medias` array of the relevant subsection.
    - Extract captions from nearby text (typically labeled as "Figure X:", "Table X:", or similar patterns), and set `markdown_caption` to the extracted caption or `null` if none found.
    - For images (e.g., `![alt text](path/to/image)`):
      - Set `path` to the image path (e.g., `path/to/image`)
      - Set `markdown_content` to the complete image markdown (e.g., `![alt text](path/to/image)`)
    - For tables (markdown tables starting with `|`):
      - Set `path` to `null`
      - Set `markdown_content` to the complete table markdown including all rows (e.g., `| Col1 | Col2 |\n|------|------|\n| A    | B    |`)
  5. Extract Available Metadata: Extract available metadata (e.g., title, author, publish date, organization, etc.) from the sectionâ€™s content or context; include only the keys for which data is present.

  Example Output:
  {
      "metadata": {
          `key`: `value` // leave it empty if no metadata is present
      },
      "title": "Section 1",
      "subsections": [
          {
              "title": "Subsection 1.1",
              "content": "Refined content of subsection 1.1"
          },
          {
              "title": "Subsection 1.2",
              "content": "Refined content with image",
              "medias": [
                  {
                      "markdown_content": "![](path/to/image)",
                      "markdown_caption": "Caption inferred from nearby text", // `null` if no caption is found
                      "path": "path/to/image"
                  }
              ]
          },
          {
              "title": "Subsection 1.3",
              "content": "Refined content with table",
              "medias": [
                  {
                      "markdown_content": "| Col1 | Col2 |\n|------|------|\n| A    | B    |",
                      "markdown_caption": "Table 1 caption from nearby text",
                      "path": null
                  },
                  {
                      "markdown_content": "| Col1 | Col2 |\n|------|------|\n| A    | B    |",
                      "markdown_caption": "Table 2 caption from nearby text",
                      "path": null
                  }
              ]
          }
      ]
  }
