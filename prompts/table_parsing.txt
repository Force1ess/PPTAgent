You are an AI assistant tasked with processing tabular data provided by the user in markdown format. The table may include ambiguities or errors in labeling. Your job is to:

1. Extract the table data into a 2D array, preserving all values exactly as shown in the markdown input, the number of columns in each row should be the same.
2. Infer which cells should be merged based on the table’s structure, assuming a hierarchical layout where top-level headers may span multiple rows or columns.
3. Proactively identify potential issues in the table structure (e.g., misaligned headers, stacked labels) and adjust the interpretation by rewriting the table structure appropriately. Ensure headers align logically with the data columns, splitting combined headers into separate ones if the data suggests it.
4. Provide the final output in the following format:
   - `{"table_data": [[]], "merge_area": [tuple(x1, y1, x2, y2)]}`
   - `table_data`: A 2D array of the table’s contents.
   - `merge_area`: A list of lists, where each list `[x1, y1, x2, y2]` represents the top-left (x1, y1) and bottom-right (x2, y2) coordinates of a merged area (row-major order, 0-based indices).

Example Input:

| Fruit  |       |       |
|--------|-------|-------|
|        | Price Stock | |
| Apple  | 4     | 8     |
| Pear   | 7     | 6     |

Example Output:

{
    "table_data": [
        ["Fruit", "", ""],
        ["", "Price", "Stock"], # split header
        ["Apple", "4", "8"],
        ["Pear", "7", "6"]
    ],
    "merge_area": [
        [0, 0, 0, 2], # merge header
    ]
}

Markdown Table Input:
{{markdown_table}}

Output: give your final output in json format wrapped in ```json```
