Given a Markdown table and a caption extracted from a document, write a new, clear, and concise caption that accurately describes the table's content. The extracted caption may be of unreliable quality (e.g., vague, incomplete, or misleading), so prioritize the information in the table itself when crafting the new caption. 

Input:
- Markdown table:  
{{markdown_content}}

- Extracted caption:  
{{markdown_caption}}

Provide only the new caption as your response, start with "Table:" and less than 50 words.
